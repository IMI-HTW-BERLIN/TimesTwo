## Ideas
  - Time-Bending abilites: 
    - Pause/Continue time, Slow-down/Speed-up time
    - Player can stop time of one object, but it affects him as well
  - Two players: 
    - Unique abilities, e.g. one pause/continue, other rest
    - Same ability but when used the player can not move freely
    
## Must Have
  - Objects to be moved/manipulated for solving a level e.g. cube, sphere
  - Two players: Splitscreen and/or local multiplayer
  - Time-logic/mechanics: Slow down player and objects time 
  
## Should Have

  - Gameplay -> More levels
  - Power-ups (either items (dynamic) or specific regions (static))
  - Sounds
